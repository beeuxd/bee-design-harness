# Details that make interfaces feel better

Great interfaces rarely come from a single thing. It's usually a collection of small details that compound into a great experience. Apply these principles when building or reviewing UI code.

When reviewing, slow the interface down: replay motion at 10% speed in the browser's Animations panel and walk every state: hover, focus, active, loading, empty. What feels off at 10% speed is what's subtly wrong at full speed.

Preserve the project's component library, tokens, and density. Match its established motion language except where a principle below prescribes an exact interaction pattern.

Typography (text wrapping, font rendering, tabular numbers, spacing) is covered by the `better-typography` skill; use that for anything text-related. Accessibility (hit areas, focus states, keyboard support, ARIA, reduced motion) is covered by the `better-accessibility` skill. Layout structure (grouping, spacing between sections, breakpoints, spatial RTL) is covered by the `better-layout` skill.

## Quick Reference

| Category | When to Use |
| --- | --- |
| [Surfaces](surfaces.md) | Border radius, optical alignment, shadows, image outlines |
| [Animations](animations.md) | Interruptible animations, enter/exit transitions, icon animations, scale on press, motion restraint |
| [Icons](icons.md) | Icon stroke weight, states via `currentColor`, outline vs fill, sizing, RTL flipping |
| [Performance](performance.md) | Transition specificity, `will-change` usage |

## Core Principles

### 1. Concentric Border Radius

Outer radius = inner radius + padding. Mismatched radii on nested elements is the most common thing that makes interfaces feel off.

### 2. Optical Over Geometric Alignment

When geometric centering looks off, align optically. Buttons with icons, play triangles, and asymmetric icons all need manual adjustment.

### 3. Shadows for Elevation, Borders for Structure

For buttons, cards, and containers whose border exists only to create depth, prefer layered transparent `box-shadow` values. Keep borders that communicate structure or state: dividers, layout separators, and selected or focus states.

### 4. Interruptible Animations

Use CSS transitions for interactive state changes: they can be interrupted mid-animation. Reserve keyframes for staged sequences that run once.

### 5. Split and Stagger Enter Animations

For an infrequent staged entrance where sequence helps communicate hierarchy, break content into semantic chunks and stagger them by ~100ms instead of animating one container. Do not stagger routine, high-frequency interactions.

### 6. Subtle Exit Animations

Use a small fixed `translateY` instead of full height. Exits should be softer than enters. Use `ease-out` for both enter and exit transitions.

### 7. Contextual Icon Animations

Animate icons with `opacity`, `scale`, and `blur` instead of toggling visibility. Use exactly these values: scale from `0.25` to `1`, opacity from `0` to `1`, blur from `4px` to `0px`. If the project has `motion` or `framer-motion` in `package.json`, match that package's import path (or the established nearby imports when both exist) and use `transition: { type: "spring", duration: 0.3, bounce: 0 }`; bounce must always be `0`. If no motion library is installed, keep both icons in the DOM (one absolute-positioned) and cross-fade with CSS transitions using `cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1)`; this gives both enter and exit animations without any dependency.

### 8. Image Outlines

Add a subtle `1px` outline with low opacity to images for consistent depth. The color must be pure black in light mode (`oklch(0 0 0 / 0.1)`) and pure white in dark mode (`oklch(1 0 0 / 0.1)`), never a near-black like slate, zinc, or any tinted neutral. A tinted outline picks up the surface color underneath it and reads as dirt on the image edge.

### 9. Scale on Press

A subtle `scale(0.96)` on click gives buttons tactile feedback. Always use `0.96`. Never use a value smaller than `0.95`: anything below feels exaggerated. Add a `static` prop to disable it when motion would be distracting.

### 10. Skip Animation on Page Load

Use `initial={false}` on `AnimatePresence` to prevent enter animations on first render. Verify it doesn't break intentional entrance animations.

### 11. Never Use `transition: all`

Always specify exact properties: `transition-property: scale, opacity`. Tailwind's `transition-transform` covers `transform, translate, scale, rotate`.

### 12. Use `will-change` Sparingly

Only for `transform`, `opacity`, `filter`, the properties the GPU can composite. Never use `will-change: all`. Only add when you notice first-frame stutter.

### 13. Match Icon Stroke to Text Weight

An icon next to text carries the text's optical weight: `1.5px` stroke beside regular (400) text, `2px` beside semibold (600). One stroke weight per icon set; never mix libraries on one surface.

### 14. One SVG, Recolored per State

Icons use `currentColor` and get their states (hover, selected, disabled) from CSS color and opacity, never from separate assets. Outline variant is the default; fill variant marks the active state.

### 15. Motion Restraint

No custom animation on high-frequency interactions: the attention cost repeats on every trigger. Motion is never the only feedback channel; every animated state change also needs a static cue (color, icon, label).

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Same border radius on closely nested parent and child | Calculate `outerRadius = innerRadius + padding` |
| Icons look off-center | Adjust optically with padding or fix SVG directly |
| Border used only to fake elevation | Use layered `box-shadow` with transparency; keep structural and state borders |
| Jarring staged entrance or contextual exit | Stagger infrequent entrances and keep context-preserving exits subtle |
| Stateful icon or toggle animates its default state on page load | Add `initial={false}` to that `AnimatePresence`; preserve intentional page entrances |
| `transition: all` on elements | Specify exact properties |
| First-frame animation stutter | Add `will-change: transform` (sparingly) |
| Hairline icon beside bold text | Match the stroke width to the text weight |
| Separate icon assets per state | One `currentColor` SVG, states via CSS |
| Filled icons everywhere | Outline as default, fill only for the active state |
| Entrance animation on every hover or keystroke | Instant feedback or ≤150ms opacity/color transition |


## Component Building Principles

### Buttons must feel responsive

Add `transform: scale(0.97)` on `:active`. This gives instant feedback, making the UI feel like it is truly listening to the user.

```css
.button {
  transition: transform 160ms ease-out;
}

.button:active {
  transform: scale(0.97);
}
```

This applies to any pressable element. The scale should be subtle (0.95-0.98).

### Never animate from scale(0)

Nothing in the real world disappears and reappears completely. Elements animating from `scale(0)` look like they come out of nowhere.

Start from `scale(0.9)` or higher, combined with opacity. Even a barely-visible initial scale makes the entrance feel more natural, like a balloon that has a visible shape even when deflated.

```css
/* Bad */
.entering {
  transform: scale(0);
}

/* Good */
.entering {
  transform: scale(0.95);
  opacity: 0;
}
```

### Make popovers origin-aware

Popovers should scale in from their trigger, not from center. The default `transform-origin: center` is wrong for almost every popover. **Exception: modals.** Modals should keep `transform-origin: center` because they are not anchored to a specific trigger. They appear centered in the viewport.

```css
/* Radix UI */
.popover {
  transform-origin: var(--radix-popover-content-transform-origin);
}

/* Base UI */
.popover {
  transform-origin: var(--transform-origin);
}
```

Whether the user notices the difference individually does not matter. In the aggregate, unseen details become visible. They compound.

### Tooltips: skip delay on subsequent hovers

Tooltips should delay before appearing to prevent accidental activation. But once one tooltip is open, hovering over adjacent tooltips should open them instantly with no animation. This feels faster without defeating the purpose of the initial delay.

```css
.tooltip {
  transition: transform 125ms ease-out, opacity 125ms ease-out;
  transform-origin: var(--transform-origin);
}

.tooltip[data-starting-style],
.tooltip[data-ending-style] {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: scale(0.97);
}

/* Skip animation on subsequent tooltips */
.tooltip[data-instant] {
  transition-duration: 0ms;
}
```

### Use CSS transitions over keyframes for interruptible UI

CSS transitions can be interrupted and retargeted mid-animation. Keyframes restart from zero. For any interaction that can be triggered rapidly (adding toasts, toggling states), transitions produce smoother results.

```css
/* Interruptible - good for UI */
.toast {
  transition: transform 400ms ease;
}

/* Not interruptible - avoid for dynamic UI */
@keyframes slideIn {
  from {
    transform: translateY(100%);
  }
  to {
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}
```

### Use blur to mask imperfect transitions

When a crossfade between two states feels off despite trying different easings and durations, add subtle `filter: blur(2px)` during the transition.

**Why blur works:** Without blur, you see two distinct objects during a crossfade. The old state and the new state overlapping. This looks unnatural. Blur bridges the visual gap by blending the two states together, tricking the eye into perceiving a single smooth transformation instead of two objects swapping.

Combine blur with scale-on-press (`scale(0.97)`) for a polished button state transition:

```css
.button {
  transition: transform 160ms ease-out;
}

.button:active {
  transform: scale(0.97);
}

.button-content {
  transition: filter 200ms ease, opacity 200ms ease;
}

.button-content.transitioning {
  filter: blur(2px);
  opacity: 0.7;
}
```

Keep blur under 20px. Heavy blur is expensive, especially in Safari.

### Animate enter states with @starting-style

The modern CSS way to animate element entry without JavaScript:

```css
.toast {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: translateY(0);
  transition: opacity 400ms ease, transform 400ms ease;

  @starting-style {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(100%);
  }
}
```

This replaces the common React pattern of using `useEffect` to set `mounted: true` after initial render. Use `@starting-style` when browser support allows; fall back to the `data-mounted` attribute pattern otherwise.

```jsx
// Legacy pattern (still works everywhere)
useEffect(() => {
  setMounted(true);
}, []);
// <div data-mounted={mounted}>
```

## The Sonner Principles (Building Loved Components)

These principles come from building Sonner (13M+ weekly npm downloads) and apply to any component:

1. **Developer experience is key.** No hooks, no context, no complex setup. Insert `<Toaster />` once, call `toast()` from anywhere. The less friction to adopt, the more people will use it.

2. **Good defaults matter more than options.** Ship beautiful out of the box. Most users never customize. The default easing, timing, and visual design should be excellent.

3. **Naming creates identity.** "Sonner" (French for "to ring") feels more elegant than "react-toast". Sacrifice discoverability for memorability when appropriate.

4. **Handle edge cases invisibly.** Pause toast timers when the tab is hidden. Fill gaps between stacked toasts with pseudo-elements to maintain hover state. Capture pointer events during drag. Users never notice these, and that is exactly right.

5. **Use transitions, not keyframes, for dynamic UI.** Toasts are added rapidly. Keyframes restart from zero on interruption. Transitions retarget smoothly.

6. **Build a great documentation site.** Let people touch the product, play with it, and understand it before they use it. Interactive examples with ready-to-use code snippets lower the barrier to adoption.

### Cohesion matters

Sonner's animation feels satisfying partly because the whole experience is cohesive. The easing and duration fit the vibe of the library. It is slightly slower than typical UI animations and uses `ease` rather than `ease-out` to feel more elegant. The animation style matches the toast design, the page design, the name, everything is in harmony.

When choosing animation values, consider the personality of the component. A playful component can be bouncier. A professional dashboard should be crisp and fast. Match the motion to the mood.

### The opacity + height combination

When items enter and exit a list (like Family's drawer), the opacity change must work well with the height animation. This is often trial and error. There is no formula. You adjust until it feels right.

### Review your work the next day

Review animations with fresh eyes. You notice imperfections the next day that you missed during development. Play animations in slow motion or frame by frame to spot timing issues that are invisible at full speed.

### Asymmetric enter/exit timing

Pressing should be slow when it needs to be deliberate (hold-to-delete: 2s linear), but release should always be snappy (200ms ease-out). This pattern applies broadly: slow where the user is deciding, fast where the system is responding.

```css
/* Release: fast */
.overlay {
  transition: clip-path 200ms ease-out;
}

/* Press: slow and deliberate */
.button:active .overlay {
  transition: clip-path 2s linear;
}
```

## Debugging Animations

### Slow motion testing

Play animations at reduced speed to spot issues invisible at full speed. Temporarily increase duration to 2-5x normal, or use browser DevTools animation inspector to slow playback.

Things to look for in slow motion:

- Do colors transition smoothly, or do you see two distinct states overlapping?
- Does the easing feel right, or does it start/stop abruptly?
- Is the transform-origin correct, or does the element scale from the wrong point?
- Are multiple animated properties (opacity, transform, color) in sync?

### Frame-by-frame inspection

Step through animations frame by frame in Chrome DevTools (Animations panel). This reveals timing issues between coordinated properties that you cannot see at full speed.

### Test on real devices

For touch interactions (drawers, swipe gestures), test on physical devices. Connect your phone via USB, visit your local dev server by IP address, and use Safari's remote devtools. The Xcode Simulator is an alternative but real hardware is better for gesture testing.

## Review Output Format

Use this format only when the user asks for a standalone UI-polish review. When a broader review skill (e.g. an orchestrating interface review) coordinates this review, provide domain evidence and findings to that skill and let its output format, severity scale, consolidation rules, cap, and verdict take precedence.

Present the standalone review in two parts.

### Findings

Group all confirmed findings by principle. Use a markdown table with **Severity**, **Location**, **Before**, **After**, and **Why** columns. Never use separate "Before:" / "After:" lines.

- **Severity**: `HIGH` makes an interaction misleading, unresponsive, or repeatedly disruptive; `MEDIUM` creates a noticeable craft or consistency problem; `LOW` is isolated polish.
- **Location**: cite `path/to/file:line`. If the artifact has no source files, cite the exact screen and component instead.
- **Before / After**: show the current implementation and an actionable replacement.
- **Why**: name the violated principle and explain how it affects the interface.

Consolidate a repeated systemic issue into one row and list every affected location. Omit principles with no findings.

### Example

#### Concentric border radius
| Severity | Location | Before | After | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LOW | `src/Card.tsx:28` | `rounded-xl` on card + `rounded-xl` on inner button (`p-2`) | `rounded-2xl` on card (`8 + 8 = 16`), `rounded-lg` on inner button | Nested corners should be concentric |
| LOW | `src/card.css:11` | `border-radius: 16px` on both nested surfaces | Outer `24px`, inner `16px` with `8px` padding | Equal nested radii make the inner surface look pinched |

#### Scale on press
| Severity | Location | Before | After | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LOW | `src/Button.tsx:19` | `<button className="...">` | Add `active:scale-[0.96] transition-transform` | Press feedback makes the control feel responsive |
| MEDIUM | `src/button.css:24` | `scale(0.9)` on press | Raise to `scale(0.96)` | Anything below `0.95` feels exaggerated |

### Verification and Verdict

After the findings:

1. **Verification**: list the exact checks run and their observed results. Walk every relevant state and inspect motion at 10% speed when animation is involved. If a check was not run, state what still needs verification.
2. **Verdict**: `Block` if any `HIGH` finding remains, `Needs changes` if only `MEDIUM` or `LOW` findings remain, and `Approve` only when no actionable findings remain.

When there are no findings, omit the tables, state "No actionable UI-polish findings", report verification, and end with `Approve`.
